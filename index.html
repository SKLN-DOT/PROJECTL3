            <h2>Importance of coding.</h2>
            <p>1. Coding Develops Logical and Computational Thinking
            Coding encourages the use of logical reasoning and algorithms to create programs. When tackling a new challenge, you
            must employ a logical approach to find a solution, thus exercising and enhancing your logical abilities.
            
            This process is a key part of 'Computational Thinking', an essential skill in today's digitised world. It's about
            breaking down complex issues, recognises patterns, and develops step-by-step solutions. In Preface School of Technology,
            we teach students to think critically, apply effective reasoning, and solve problems across various contexts, enhancing
            their analytical skills.
            
            This skill is not only crucial for coding but also beneficial in everyday life, promoting structured thinking and
            problem-solving. A huge part of Prefaceâ€™s educational philosophy is about Computational Thinking, as we aim to equip
            children and adults with unique problem-solving skill sets that they can apply in their personal and professional lives
            in the future.
